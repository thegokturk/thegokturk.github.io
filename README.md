# Project Name: Gokturk Website
**Version: 1.0.0**  

## Description
``HTML, CSS and JavaScript`` which are the most common features of ``web development`` were used  in this project. The website presents the history of a state in the 7th century with visuals in a beautiful and simple way to understand. It is my personal project and not a school project.  

## Background and idea
My friend, who creates content on social media about historical information, said he found a great website with great visuals and about the history of the Mongol Empire. When I viewed this website, I was also impressed as he was. At that time I had learned Python and was learning ``front-end development``. I wanted to do a project with the things I learned and this gave me a great idea.  
I decided to create a website about the Turkic Khaganate (also known as Göktürk  Khaganate), which is one of the most famous states in the history of the Turkic peoples and has many successors states such as the Mongol Empire.  
Today, front-end is a highly automated technology, even people who don't know anything about web development can easily choose a design from many websites and create their own website. The back-end is a much more valuable technology that has not yet been automated to this extent. For this reason, I'm also learning back-end, but I did not need any back-end technology in this project.  
With front-end automation, more professional designs can be made much easier. However, I did not use any ready-made design or front-end automations for this project, I wanted to see what I knew and how much I could do by myself, thus I wrote all the codes and made all the designs myself.  

## Content
The ``/img{number}`` folders contain images used on the website. All images except the flag are my own design. Some of these images were designed with ``Midjourney AI``, and some of them were designed with the character design screen in the video game ``Crusader Kings II``. The copyrights of these images belong to me.  

None of the mp3 files in the ``/musics`` folder belong to me, the sources of all mp3 files are included in the ``musics.html`` file and on the website. All copyright owners of the music are clearly stated.
