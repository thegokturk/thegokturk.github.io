            <h2>Life </h2>
            <p>Ashina Helu Khagan was the last khagan of the Western Turkic Khaganate ruled between 651–658. He was son
                of Böri-Shad. He was awarded with the title shad by Duolu Qaghan in 633 and oppointed to govern certain
                tribes including Chuye, Qarluq, Nushibi. In 646 he rose against Irbis Seguy but defeated by him. He fled
                to China in 25 April 648. </p>

            <h2>War against Tang </h2>
            <p>He soon started to plan to assert independence using Taizong's death in 649. After a while he set up his
                horde near modern Shuanghe, began to receive submissions. According to Tongjian firstly Duolu tribe
                chiefs who were titled as čor, namely Chomuqun chief Kuli, Ulugh Oq chief Kul, Chapshata chief Ton,
                Turgesh chief and Shungish chief Chuban joined him. Ulugh Oq chief was also a son-in-law to Helu. After
                formally reasserting independence from Tang, he commanded raids to Jin Ling and Pulei. Angered Gaozong
                stripped him of Chinese titles and ordered Qibi Heli and Liang Jianfang to secure border areas. He
                fought against Tang Dynasty every time after he became khagan. But he had not too much power and he was
                defeated. After being captured he reportedly told Xiao Siya.</p>

            <p>"I am defeated. The former emperor supported me and was awarded me richly. Alas, I turned my back on him
                and rebelled. My defeat today is a result of Heaven's anger and punishment. What could I say! I heard
                according to Han customs, criminals are executed in the capital. My wish is to die in Zhaoling."</p>

            <p>Emperor Gaozong spared him after 15 days and he lived out his days at the Tang capital Chang'an. He was
                buried near Illig Qaghan's memorial. He was the last khagan, and his death meant the fall of the Western
                Turkic Khaganate. The Göktürks did not exist in history for a very short time. However, the collapse of
                all Göktürk states did not mean the end of the Göktürks. Etmish Beg's 3 sons will establish a Göktürk
                state again! </p>
