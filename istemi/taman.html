            <h2>Life </h2>
            <p>Arslan Taman Qaghan or Taman Qaghan is the son of Niri Qaghan and the third khagan of Western Turkic
                Khaganate. Not much is known about his reign. He was said to be collecting excessive taxes from the
                Chile tribe, leading to resentment among the Tiele tribe. Khagan thus suspected the Tiele chieftains
                and, on one occasion, gathered some 100 Tiele chieftains and slaughtered them. Tiele thereafter rebelled
                and supported Geleng the chieftain of the Qibi, as the Yiwuzhenmohe Khan. They also supported Yishibo as
                Yiedie Khan, as a subordinate khan under Geleng. About 605 Tiele rebels drove him from Dzungaria to the
                Ili River area. Sui suggested forming an alliance with Tamans subordinate Shekui, who had been
                requesting to marry a Sui princess. Shekui was uncle of Taman. Emperor Yang agreed and subsequently,
                Shekui attacked Taman with help of Sui, defeating him and forcing him to flee to Gaochang.</p>

            <p>Taman subsequently stayed in China and did not return to his own land. Taman also married a Sui
                princess. By 619, he was no longer in control of his khaganate and was at Chang'an, the capital of
                China's Tang Dynasty, when Emperor Gaozu of Tang, giving in to Shibi khagan's pressure, had him
                delivered to Eastern Turk emissaries to be executed. He was survived by two sons who were in service of
                the Tang dynasty thereafter. </p>
