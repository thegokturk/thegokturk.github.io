            <h2>Civil War and spies</h2>
            <p>After Taspar Qaghan's death, a struggle for the throne began between the 4 Göktürk princes. This fight was won by Kara Qaghan's son, Ishbara Qaghan. While the other 2 princes accepted him to win the throne, 1 prince never did. This was Mukan Qaghan's son Apa. Apa fled north where he declared himself khagan. While these throne wars were taking place in Turkic Khaganate, the situation was very different in China. The Chou Dynasty was overthrown and replaced by the Sui Dynasty. The Sui Dynasty was a very powerful dynasty that will unite China 400 years later. And at the same time, most of the Gökürks nobility's wives were Chinese princesses. But not all of them were just women who got pregnant from the Turks, some of them were spies. And these spies were a serious danger to the Göktürks. A spy named Sun-Sheng, who was friends with Ishbara, went hunting with him, and discovered the country's borders, military power and geographical structure one by one. He presented what he had learned as a report to Emperor Wen of Sui. The most important part of this report was that the Turks can only be destroyed by civil wars! Thereupon, while the Apa Qaghan rebellion was still going on, Emperor Wen sent an envoy to Tardu who was a Göktürk prince and the governor of the western part of the Turkic Khaganate. Emperor said that he deserved the throne and was stronger than Ishbara. At the same time, he sent an envoy to Ishbara's brother Bagha and started to incite him against his brother. </p>

            <h2>First Göktürk-Sui War of 581</h2>
            <p>Ishbara was not stupid. He heard all those. Therefore, he said that he would prepare his army and make the biggest attack in Göktürk history against the Sui Dynasty. He also summoned other nobles in the country, including Apa Qaghan, to this army. Apa, on the other hand, had agreed to become governor in the north. Tardu, Bagha Apa and Ishbara had prepared and set out for the land of Sui. The country of Sui suffered heavy losses in the face of this unexpected attack. There was no land that was not burned or looted in Northern Sui. The Göktürks captured many cities and castles in the north. Ishbara was now close to the capital Chanan. The Sui capital was besieged. However, Emperor Wen's efforts of discord and treachery were not in vain. Tardu took his armies and left the war for no reason. And a rebellion started in Turkic Khaganate. Ishbara, on the other hand, had to leave the war unfinished and return. However, the Göktürks still won a decisive victory. The Sui Dynasty was almost destroyed and very tired as a result of this war. Göktürks plundered everything in the north of China. </p>

            <h2>Second Göktürk-Sui War of 583</h2>
            <p>After Emperor Wen issued an edict and gathered all the generals, the Sui army consisted of hundreds of thousands of soldiers. He wanted to attack Göktürks for revenge. Although Ishbara Qaghan and his army, who were very worn out as a result of internal problems, came against them, Ishbara lost this war and escaped without dying in the war. The Sui army did not advance any further after this victory. They did not want to continue the war and wear out their armies. Instead, they continued to provoke other Göktürk princes. Tardu Qaghan first rebelled and established a state in the west called the West Turkic Khaganate. Apa Qaghan revolted again. Ishbara defeated him, but Apa fled and took refuge in Tardu. Serious uprisings continued in the west of the country. Ishbara was so helpless that she made peace with the Sui Emperor and sought his help. Emperor Wen's treacherous plans were going very well. Emperor Wen now saw Ishbara as a needy person. He thought that he wasn't a threat anymore and sent him help. With this help, Ishbara defeated Apa again. Ishbara, who did not live long after this victory, died in 587. </p>
