            <h2>War against Juan-Juan</h2>
            <p>After Kara became Qaghan. He began to struggle to complete the work left unfinished by his father. He defeated Teng-shu-tse on the Mulai mountain. He was the cousin of Anakui of the Juan-Juan, who was defeated by his father Bumin. Then Teng-shu-tse and his soldiers took refuge in the Western Wei. Later, Kara Qaghan, who remained on the throne for only 1 year, fell ill in 553. If he dies, he willed that his brother Mukan should succeed him, not his son. He died in 553 shortly after he made this will, and his brother Mukan became the new Qaghan of the Göktürks and the second Khagan of Turkic Khaganate.</p>
