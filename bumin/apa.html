            <h2>Rebellion and Civil War</h2>
            <p>Apa Qaghan was son of Mukan Qaghan, declared himself qaghan of the Turkic Khaganate. His claim of power came with the death of Taspar. He did not accept Ishbara Qaghan as rightful emperor, leading to the Göktürk Civil War. After Taspar Qaghan's death, a struggle for the throne began between the 4 Göktürk princes. This fight was won by Kara Qaghan's son, Ishbara Qaghan. He was a cousin of Apa. While the other 2 princes accepted him to win the throne, 1 prince never did. This was Mukan Qaghan's son Apa. Apa fled north where he declared himself khagan. Later, Ishbara Qaghan accepted Apa Qaghan as governor of the north. Apa also became a General in the first Göktürk-Sui War in 581. But even if Göktürks won this war, Apa Qaghan revolted again in 583. Ishbara defeated him, but Apa fled and took refuge in Tardu. Serious uprisings continued in the west of the country. Ishbara was so helpless that she made peace with the Sui Emperor and sought his help. Emperor Wen now saw Ishbara as a needy person. He thought that he wasn't a threat anymore and sent him help. With this help, Ishbara defeated Apa again. Ishbara, who did not live long after this victory, died in 587. Bagha Qaghan became the new khagan in 587, replacing his older brother Ishbara. When the Sui Dynasty envoy arrived at Bagha Qaghan, Bagha asked for support to completely eliminate Apa, who had put the state in difficult situations since 582. The Sui Dynasty also approved this proposal. Bagha Qaghan, attacking Apa's location, captured him alive. In fact, most of Apa's soldiers had gone and surrendered themselves to Bagha Qaghan. Apa was not a brave and good Turk like his father Mukan. Sometimes good fathers have bad sons too. Apa was killed in 587, the year he was captured. </p>
