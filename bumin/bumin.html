            <h2>Origin and first times</h2>
            <p>The place where the Göktürks first appeared is the Altai Mountains. There are many legends about their emergence, but none of them are conclusively proven by sources. In the Altai Mountains, the Ashina family lived in Juan-Juan, the state of the Tungusic people who controlled Central Asia at that time. Göktürks, who established a state in the south of the Altai Mountains as the vassals of Juan-Juan, first appeared on the stage of history with the plundering operation of the Western Wei Dynasty, a Chinese state, in 542. At the head of this state was Bumin Qaghan, the head of the Ashina family. Bumin Qaghan further strengthened the economy of his state by trading in iron and silk in 545. The Western Wei Dynasty wanted to establish good relations with this newly emerging power and sent an emissary to Bumin Qaghan. This was great news because it was the first time that the Turkic Khaganate was officially recognized by a state. The following year, Bumin sent an envoy to them back and relations improved.</p>

            <h2>Töles revolt and rise</h2>
            <p>The biggest step taken by the Göktürks on the way to becoming a state is undoubtedly the obedience of fifty thousand families of the Töles tribes, a Turkic tribe. The Töles, who were preparing to attack the Juan-Juans, the largest state in Central Asia at that time, were defeated by Bumin in a great raid. Fifty thousand families obeyed the Göktürks. Thus, the sudden increase in the number of people caused the power of the Göktürks to increase more.</p>

            <h2>War against Juan-Juan</h2>
            <p>Bumin, who suppressed this great revolt against the Juan-Juan, now saw himself as a warrior equal to the emperor. Therefore, Bumin asked the Juan-Juan Emperor Anakui to give his daughter to marry himself. At this, Anakui got very angry and insulted Bumin and said, "You are my slave." Bumin became very angry and realized that he should no longer be a Juan-Juan vassal and establish his own state. He immediately declared his independence and proclaimed himself Khan. He also asked the Western Wei Emperor to give his daughter to be allies. Thereupon, Emperor Wen accepted this offer and gave his daughter Changlo to Bumin Qaghan as his wife. The Göktürk Khaganate and Bumin Qaghan, which declared their independence in 552, had now entered a war against the Juan-Juans. Emperor Anakui and Bumin Khagan met in Huai-Huang Square in 552 and battle started. Bumin won this battle. After the battle, Anakui committed suicide to avoid being taken prisoner. After the war, Bumin captured Ötüken and made it the capital. Bumin was declared the first Ilkhan and now became the leader of the Turks. Bumin then expanded the state borders further in the steppes and gave the governorship of the western part of the country to his brother Istemi Yabgu. Bumin Qaghan died in 552, the same year he founded the state. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Kara Qaghan.</p>
