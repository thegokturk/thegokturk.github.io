            <h2>Life</h2>
            <p>Before Mukan died, he had willed his brother Taspar to ascend to the throne. Therefore, Taspar became the new khagan. The two states in China, which closely followed this change of throne, immediately took action and tried to establish friendly relations with the new khagan. The Chou state sent one hundred thousand embroidered and raw silk fabrics to Taspar Qaghan. Since the Chi state was also afraid of their attack, they hastily delivered a large amount of gifts to Taspar with an envoy. Taspar Qaghan now thought that he had completely dominated both Chinese states. That's why he was saying, "Why are my two sons in the south fighting for no reason?" </p>

            <h2>Religion problem</h2>
            <p>Meanwhile, the Chou-Chi wars in the south of the state, namely in North China, were continuing at full speed. Both states were competing to be friends with the Göktürks. However, Taspar could not benefit enough from this and made the mistake of introducing the influence of Buddhism into the country. At the end of 572, Taspar sent an emissary to the Chi Dynasty and offered to marry one of their princesses. Taspar's policy towards the Chi Dynasty gradually turned into admiration. The Buddhist monk Hti-Lin, who was captured during a plunder and taken to Ötüken, played a major role. This monk told Taspar'a that the main reason why the country of Chi is so rich is that the principles of Buddhism are applied in the country and that everyone believes in this religion. Taspar also believed them. Thus, Taspar left Tengrism, the religion of the Turks, and came under the influence of Buddhism. The Göktürk people, on the other hand, were not happy with this change of religion of the khagan. </p>

            <h2>Chi-Chou wars</h2>
            <p>The Chi Dynasty collapsed as a result of the Chi-Chou wars, its lands passed into the hands of the Chou Dynasty. Taspar, on the other hand, said that he supported the Chi statesmen who took refuge in him and supported them to save their country. Taspar Qaghan, who supported them from the beginning, gave them the Göktürk army as an aid army and sent them back to China. The Göktürk army attacked the provinces of the Chou Dynasty in 578. They plundered and killed the officers and people they captured. Although Liu-Hsiung, one of the commanders of the Chou, commanded his soldiers, he faced the Göktürk army, but was defeated by the Göktürk army. He was killed on the battlefield. Six great Chinese armies were prepared against the Göktürks. The Chou emperor tried to resist the Göktürks by personally commanding his army. The death of Chou Emperor Wu delighted Kao-Chaoi, who wanted to resurrect the Chi state. However, this attempt to revive the Chi state was not completed. Chou commander Shen-Chu besieged and recaptured Fang-ang. Kao-Chaoi returned to the Turkic Khaganate. Taspar Qaghan was tired of endless wars. He sent an emissary to the Chou Dynasty, offering to make peace through marriage. The Chou Dynasty immediately accepted Taspar's offer. However, they stipulated that Kao-Chaoi be sent. Taspar did not accept this. Peace could not be made. Three months later, the Göktürk raids resumed towards Chou territory. When Taspar's armies re-entered Ping province, Chou emperor agreed to all terms in 580 and made peace with the Turkic Khaganate. Taspar Khan fell ill and died in 581. </p>
