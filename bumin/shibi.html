            <h2>Fourth Göktürk-Sui War</h2>
            <p>Although Shibi's father Yami was terribly despicable for Göktürk history, Shibi never wanted to be like his father. Shibi first declared that he would not be a vassal of the Sui Dynasty in 609. He would now become the sole khagan of the Eastern Turkic Khaganate. The Sui Dynasty decided to apply its usual tactic. They incited Shibi's brother against him. But he did not fall into this trap and told his brother about this and said that he was loyal to him. The Göktürks needed such honorable princes very much. Emperor Yang began to look for ways to get rid of Shibi. He also tried to trap and kill their merchants working for the Göktürks. But all these efforts were in vain. In the face of all this, Shibi strengthened his army even more and said, "We will put the Sui Dynasty to its limits." This time, the Göktürks came much tougher. Although Emperor Yang went to the Göktürk border with his army to prevent the attacks, Shibi Qaghan besieged him and his army. Emperor Yang's life and country were in danger. Yang's help came from Shibi's Chinese princess wife, Iceng, who was also a spy. Iceng wrote a fake letter to her husband, Shibi, saying that there was a riot in the country. Then Shibi Qaghan returned. Yang had saved his life, but had lost the battle. Then he lost all his prestige. Revolts began in the Sui Dynasty. Rebelling statesmen, princes, generals sought help from Shibi Qaghan. Now things were reversed and the Göktürks started to dig the well of the Sui Dynasty. Shibi, on the other hand, supported all of these rebels, just as the Sui Dynasty did in the past. As a result of these revolts, which continued until 618, the Sui Dynasty was destroyed and the Tang Dynasty was established in its place. The Tang Dynasty was a state founded with the help of Shibi Qaghan. Upon these events, Shibi, who was a khagan worthy of their ancestors and resurrected the victorious Göktürks, fell ill and died in 619. </p>
