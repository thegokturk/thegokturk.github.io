            <h2>Third Göktürk-Sui War</h2>
            <p>Tulan Qaghan became the new khagan in 588 after the unexpected death of his uncle Bagha Qaghan. Meanwhile, the Sui Dynasty destroyed the southern Chinese states and began to rule China alone. Some statesmen from the states in the south fled to Göktürk lands to take shelter to Tayi, the Chinese princess wife of Tulan Qaghan. Tayi also wanted to dethrone Sui Emperor Wen and become empress himself. She tried to persuade Tulan Qaghan to start a war for this. However, the Sui Dynasty learned about these events and wanted Tayi to die. Tulan, who did not have much power, killed his wife in order not to start a war. However, Emperor Wen still didn't trust Tulan. He said that Yami, who was the governor in the north and brother of Tulan, would take support for the throne. Tulan Qaghan was enraged and no longer wanted to seek help from the Sui Dynasty for the civil war. Instead, he allied himself with Tulan Qaghan, ruler of the Western Turkic Khaganate. After suppressing the Yami Qaghan rebellion, Tulan and Tardu felt it was time to attack the Sui Dynasty. That's why he attacked Sui lands again with Tardu Qaghan. But this was a futile effort. Tardu and Tulan failed to defeat the much stronger Sui Dynasty and retreated. It was Yami who profited the most from this war. Tulan's brother Yami was proclaimed Qaghan by Emperor Wen. Sui was unequivocally supportive of Yami. </p>

            <h2>Rebellions</h2>
            <p>Revolts started in Turkic Khaganate. Tulan did not become a victorious commander like his ancestors. Qaghan had lost his prestige in the public eye. This state, which went down in history as the First Turkic Khaganate, was now weakened. There is a rule in the steppe. Here states would rise very quickly and fall very quickly. Although the Turkic Khaganate looked like these states, it was not. Even if the Turkic Khaganate was destroyed, a state would be re-established and would rise again! Tulan died in 600 while fighting against the revolts. </p>
