            <h2>Life </h2>
            <p>Ozmish Qaghan was the last penultimate khagan of the Second Turkic Khaganate. He was eighth khagan
                reigned between 742-744. He was son of Pan Kul Tegin. His father Pan Kul Tigin was a governor of the
                empire during the reign of Kutluk Tengri Qaghan. Although Pan Kul Tegin had staged a successful coup
                against Kutluk Tengri, he was killed during a battle against Alp Bilge. Following a short and turbulent
                term where Alp Bilge Qaghan tried to restore the authority without success, Ozmish was elected as the
                new khagan in 742.</p>

            <p>The policy of Tang China was to vassalize all people to the north of Chinese border line and Ozmish was
                also expected to pay respect. But Ozmish rejected to aboy Tang like some khagans did in past. His
                reluctance annoyed the emperor and the emperor tasked his general Wang Zhongsi to defeat and arrest
                Ozmish. Wang Zhongsi organized a big army with Tang soldiers and also Uighurs, who was biggest enemy
                tribe of Göktürks. The coalition defeated Ozmish. Uighurs fought very well against Ozmish and Göktürks
                this time and won victory. Ozmish didn't obey Tang and tried to fight against Tang and enemy tribes but
                his cousin Alp Bilge killed him in 744. Although the Turkic people elected his son Kulun Beg as their
                new khagan, Second Turkic Khaganate is usually considered to be collapsed by the death of Ozmish Qaghan.
