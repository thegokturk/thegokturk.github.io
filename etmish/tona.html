            <h2>Life </h2>
            <p>Tona Tegin was second son of Qapaghan Qaghan and brother of Inel Qaghan. He served as a General and
                helped his father in wars like his elder brother Inel.</p>

            <p>Recapture of Samarkand by the Turkic Khaganate was perceived as a threat to the Umayyads. In those
                years, the Umayyads were already at war against the Khazar Khaganate, who was a former Göktürk vassal.
                Because of this, the Umayyads declared war on the Turkic Khaganate with the army under the command of
                Qutayba. Small-scale conflicts continued until 711. Meanwhile, his father Qapaghan Qaghan was still
                fighting against Tang Dynasty, while also dealing with the rebellious Turkic tribes. Thats why his
                father Qapaghan Qaghan did not go and fight himself. He sent his 2 sons, Inel and Tona. Inel and Tona
                took part in battles involving Umayyad attacks and commanded Göktürk army. Tona Tegin died in one of
                those battles. This battle was Siege of Beiting. Tona Tegin was killed in 714 during Siege of Beiting.
                His elder brother Inel, on the other hand, continued the struggle. In these wars, which lasted until
                716, neither side could reach a conclusion. We cannot say that the Göktürk-Umayyad wars were great wars.
                The main wars were the Turgish-Umayyad and Khazar-Umayyad wars. The Umayyads attacked the Göktürks quite
                unnecessarily, and from our point of view, this war did not go beyond harming both sides unnecessarily.</p>

            <p>Death of Tona Tegin make whole Ashina family very upset especially his father Qapaghan. </p>
