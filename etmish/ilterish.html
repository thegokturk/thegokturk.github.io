            <h2>Life </h2>
            <p>Ilterish Qaghan was the founder and first khagan of the Second Turkic Khaganate reigning between 682–692.
                He won the Göktürk independence war and became first khagan of Second Turkic Khaganate. His real name
                was Kutluk but he got the name Ilterish (means supreme savior in Turkic) after a kurultai. </p>

            <h2>Göktürk Independence War </h2>
            <p>He is one of the greatest warriors in Turkic history. As it knowns, in 630 the Eastern Turkic Khaganate
                was defeated by the Tang due to wrong policies and a terrible famine before the time of Ilterish Qaghan.
                Who saved the Turks from this interregnum period that lasted until 682, would be Ilterish Qaghan and his
                2 brothers and friend Tonyukuk. We know that there were some unsuccessful wars of independence against
                the Tang in Asia until the time of Ilterish. Ilterish, Qapaghan, Duoxifu, and Tunyukuk lived in an area
                in northern China called Chogay Lamb before embarking on the independence war. This independence
                campaign is described in Orkhon inscriptions as follows: "The Tang emperor, who thought he had so much
                power, said to destroy the Turkic nation. The Tengri of the Turk above raised Ilterish Qaghan from among
                the people and made him successful so that the Turkic nation would not perish."

            <p>Ilterish was originally a chieftain. It is known that Ilterish started the war of independence with his
                seventeen soldiers, it is known that the people who heard this came to him from the cities and
                mountains, and this war started with the support of the Turkic people. It can be seen that the power of
                Ilterish, which started with a very small amount at the beginning, has increased day by day. The Turkic
                tribes, who were scattered all around and living on their own, gathered around him as soon as they heard
                about his struggle and chose him as their khagan. Tunyukuk has a great share in this process. Tunyukuk
                describes this event as follows:</p>

            <p>"Those who stayed here and there were gathered together and there were 700 of them. He said join. I was
                the one of them who joined. I thought to myself if I should make him a khagan or not. If one sees one
                weak bull and one strong bull, one cannot distinguish which is weak and which is strong. I myself made
                him a khagan."</p>

            <p>Ilterish and General Tunyukuk raided the Chinese provinces from 681. Turkic horsemen attacked the
                Chinese borders starting from Ordos with lightning speed. Chinese troops suffered one defeat after
                another. Many captives, horses, cattle and sheep were captured as booty. Accordingly, between the years
                682-687, Ilterish and Tunyukuk made 11 raids against the Tang Dynasty.</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, in 683, Ilterish attacked Wei Prefecture and killed its prefect, Li Sijian. When Tang
                Xiujing's superior, Cui Zhibian the commandant at Feng Prefecture, tried to intercept the qaghan at
                Mount Zhaona, he was defeated and captured. In response, Emperor Gaozong considered withdrawing from
                Feng Prefecture and moving its residents to Ling Prefectures. Emperor Gaozong sent Wang, along with Li
                Chongyi, the commandant at Xia Prefecture, to defend against Göktürk attack, but he also was defeated.
                In 687, Empress Dowager Wu tried to defend against Göktürk attacks but she also didn't succeded.</p>

            <p>While this war was going on, the Tang continued to struggle with Khitan and Uyghurs. But the Tang
                Dynasty formed an alliance with the Khitan and Uyghurs and took measures against the Göktürks.
                Meanwhile, an extremely powerful person, Baz Qaghan, had taken over the Uighurs (686); Ilterish learned
                this through his messengers. From this information, we understand that the Göktürks have an important
                news network.</p>

            <p>Baz Qaghan did not sit idly by. By sending envoys to the Chinese and Khitans, he said: “The Göktürks is
                marching, their khagans are valiant, their viziers are wise. As long as those two exist, they will kill
                China and us too. Tang from the south, Khitan from the east, I'll attack from the north. Let the
                Göktürks never develop. Let's destroy them if possible." Thereupon, Ilterish, Qapaghan, Duoxifu and
                Tunyukuk were constantly making plans and thinking about how to defeat them. Tunyukuk explains this
                situation in his Inscriptions as follows: "Hearing this word, I did not sleep at night, I did not sit
                during the day. Therefore, I told my khagan, "Tang, Uighur and Khtian, if these three come together, we
                will perish. We seem to be besieged from the inside and the outside." He listened. He told me to lead
                the army to my heart's content."</p>

            <p>After this incident, Ilterish and Tunyukuk set off towards the center of Ötüken. The Göktürk army
                immediately turned to Orkun Valley. The Tang and Khitans surprisingly left their allies, the Uyghurs,
                alone. In this war, which took place on the banks of the Togla River, 3000 soldiers of the Uighurs
                encountered the Göktürk army of 2000 people. The Göktürks won the war. Baz Qaghan was also killed in
                this war (687).</p>

            <p>After that, Ötüken again passed into the hands of the Ashina family, namely the Göktürks. Thus, all the
                Turkic tribes around came from the east, west, north and south and obeyed the Göktürks again. After
                rescuing the country and restoring it to its former power, Ilterish Qaghan fell ill and died. In the
                inscriptions of his son, Bilge Qaghan, he writes about his deeds and death: "My father sent armies 47
                times, fought in twenty wars. With will of the Tengri, he made countries countryless, he made the king
                kingless, he subdued the enemies, made everyone kneel and subdued the rebels. My khagan father gained
                all this land and customs and died and went to heaven.”</p>

            <p>Ilterish is mentioned also in 10 to 12 lines of the Kul-Tigin inscription as follows:</p>

            <p>"Then Tengri above and Turkic holy Earth and Water said as follows: In order to Turkic people would not
                go to ruin and in order to should be a nation again", They rose my father Ilterish Kagan and my mother
                Ilbilga Katun, to the top and sat them upwards on the throne. My qaghan father gathered together
                seventeen brave Lords. Tengri gave them power. My father's army was like wolves, their enemies were like
                sheep."</p>

            <p>After Ilterish Qaghan's death, since his sons Bilge and Kül-Tigin were young, his brother Qapaghan
                ascended the throne in his place. </p>
